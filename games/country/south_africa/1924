South Africa International Matches 1924

overview file | 1947-1955
In 1924, a South African touring team (the 'Springbok Touring Team') travelled Ireland, Britain and the Netherlands from August 30 to December 3. They played 26 matches, including 5 against 'national teams'. Of those five, one (the match against the Netherlands) is an official international match for their opponents; the others involved the Amateur sides of the FAs involved and therefore do not count as official international matches; however, note that many European continental national teams consider their matches against e.g. the England Amateur side as official, and there is no reason for the South Africans not to have done so at the time as well.
Below the full list of matches is given, with the 'national' matches in bold face. Details on the matches against Northern Ireland and the Netherlands are also available below. Results are listed from the South African perspective. Presumably all matches were played at the home grounds of their respective opponents, but venues are only listed where confirmed.
