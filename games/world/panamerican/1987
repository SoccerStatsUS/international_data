* Final Tournament

* Note: The nations were mostly represented by their Olympic teams. None of the South American nations, nor Mexico, United States, nor Canada consider their matches as full internationals. However, the teams of Mexico, United States, Guatemala, El Salvador, Trinidad and Tobago, and Cuba may be regarded as full national teams, as the players were virtually the same as those who played in full internationals in this period. Canada was represented by its U-19 team. 

* The Mexican federation was fined 40000 Swiss Francs by FIFA on 11/12/1987 for disorderly conduct during the match vs Brazil. The Brazilian federation was fined 20000 Swiss Francs. The Mexican fine was doubled because of the aggression of masseur Gerardo Albarran against the Brazilian delegation.
