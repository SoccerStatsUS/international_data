*Notes: Denmark's team was the "Ligalandshold" (League national team), consisting 
*       only of Danish players based at Danish clubs. Their matches are considered
*       unofficial internationals by the DBU.  The Chinese team was described in 
*       Chinese sources as a "national selection", which has been interpreted here 
*       as a B-team. The full China national team was away on a training programme
*       in Brazil during this period.
