Competition: Nehru Cup
Season: 1988


*Jawaharlal Nehru Gold Cup 1988, Siliguri
*Originally scheduled to start on Jan 16, but postponed due to delays in negotiations with guest
*teams. Poland had initially stated their inability to participate, but had later agreed to
*enter only if its first match was after Jan 25. Meanwhile the AIFF was negotiating with 
*Switzerland and Morocco to replace Poland, to no avail. The other four invited nations (USSR,
*China, Bulgaria, Hungary) had already confirmed their attendance.
