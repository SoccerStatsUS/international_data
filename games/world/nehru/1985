*Notes: For many years FIFA regarded all of these matches as full internationals; however, at
* the time of writing, they retain only those matches which were contested by two A-teams (i.e.
* any two of Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Morocco, Iran, and India). All of Yugoslavia's matches
* in this tournament were regarded as full internationals by their association. The same goes for
* the Soviet Union. The Chinese and South Korean associations do not regard any of their matches
* as full internationals.
